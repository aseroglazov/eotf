"Explain on the fingers" is a project to visualize your gestures right in your camera image.

If you ever drew figures or schemas in air during conversation you would be interested in this project.
You can make simple schemes right in your camera image, creating augmented reality to other participants of call.
It's a quick and handy way to keep other people involved in conversation.
Sharing desktop or painting tools aren't necessary anymore.
